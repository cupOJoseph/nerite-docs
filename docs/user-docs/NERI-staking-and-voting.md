# NERI Staking & Voting

:::warning
**NERI token is not yet live or available. Be very diligent of scams. Go slow.** 

Guide to staking NERI tokens and participating in governance.

NERI token is the native governance token of the Nerite protocol. 

Holders have the power to:
1. Update (increase or decrease) the debt limits for each collateral type the system accepts. Setting the debt limit to 0 would essentially shutdown that collateral branch and only allow repayments.
2. Direct 25% of interest payments which the protocol earns.
3. Vote to control a shared treasury.


NERI holders do NOT have the power to:
- Mint new USDN or control user Troves.
- Upgrade the protocol or change the rules.
- Add new collateral types.
- Change the split or behavior of protocol interest payment fees.
