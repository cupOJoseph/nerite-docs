# Risk Disclosure

Detailed disclosures of protocol risks and user considerations. Nerite code has been audited several times by top firms.

## Contract Risk 

Underlying Liquity contracts are audited and secure. Nerite Protocol is a fork of Liquity and inherits most of the same risks and security considerations, but with several updates.

Nerite protocol contracts are audited by Sherlock, Recon, and other independent auditors.

Reports are available here:

## Centralization Risk

### Nerite Governance
Nerite Protocol is designed to be as decentralized and immutable as possible. The only parameters in the protocol which can be updated or changed by Nerite governance are:
1. Debt limits for each collateral type, which can be lowered at any time but only raised by a factor of 2x with a 7 day timelock.
2. Where to direct 25% of protocol fees. 

New collateral types can NOT be added by Nerite governance. 
USND can NEVER be minted by Nerite governance.
The percentage of fees that are directed to the stability pool can NOT be changed by Nerite governance.

### Arbitrum Network
Arbitrum is a decentralized network, but still relies on an emergency upgrade mechanism. For more information on this, see the [L2 Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum) tracker for Arbitrum decentralization.

Sequencer Down-time: While the Arbitrum transaction Sequencer has had 100% historic uptime, any down time of the sequencer could cause value leakage and additional risk. L2 transactions can be forced through via L1 in the case of downtime, however stale oracle prices could leak value or lead to bad debt in the protocol.

### Collaterals

It is possible that some collateral tokens could be upgraded by respective DAOs or groups in the future. Conservative debt limits and over-collateralization ratios have been chosen to limit risks of this posing any issues.
